## Introduction: A New Perspective on Trade Balance in the Digital Economy Era

In the wave of globalization and digitalization, traditional trade balance calculations no longer fully reflect the true picture of modern economics. The Trump administration proposed a 32% tariff on Taiwan's goods to the US, attempting to balance bilateral trade through "reciprocal tariffs" based on Taiwan's trade deficit with the US. However, this calculation focuses solely on physical goods trade, overlooking Taiwan's massive contributions to the US in the digital economy. As a highly digitalized economy, Taiwan purchases tens of billions of dollars in digital services from the US annually, which should be considered as US exports to Taiwan and factored into trade balance considerations.

This report aims to reassess the trade relationship between Taiwan and the US by quantifying Taiwan's purchases of US digital services (i.e., US digital exports to Taiwan) and proposing more reasonable tariff rates. Our goal is to demonstrate that Taiwan's total purchasing power from the US far exceeds current perceptions, and the 32% tariff rate should be significantly reduced to reflect the true value of bilateral economic cooperation and promote long-term stable strategic partnerships.

## The Trump Administration's Tariff Calculation Method: Formula and Limitations

### The Trump Administration's Tariff Formula

When calculating the tariff rate for Taiwan, the Trump administration used a "reciprocal tariff" method based on trade deficit. According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) documents, the original calculation formula considered import price elasticity and tariff pass-through rates, as follows:

$$
\Delta T_i = \frac{x_i - m_i}{\epsilon \times \phi \times m_i}
$$

Where:
- $\Delta T_i$: Tariff rate imposed on country i.
- $x_i$: Total US imports from country i (i.e., Taiwan's exports to the US).
- $m_i$: Total US exports to country i.
- $\epsilon$: Price elasticity of import demand, assumed to be 4.
- $\phi$: Tariff pass-through rate to import prices, assumed to be 0.25.

However, according to public information and analysis, the Trump administration simplified this formula in practice, directly calculating a "hypothetical tariff rate" (Trade Deficit Ratio, TDR), then halving it to obtain the final tariff rate. The simplified formula is as follows:

$$
TDR = \frac{x_i - m_i}{x_i}
$$

$$
Final\ Tariff\ Rate = \frac{TDR}{2}
$$

Where:
- $x_i$: Total US imports from country i (i.e., Taiwan's exports to the US).
- $m_i$: Total US exports to country i.

Based on 2025 trade data:
- Taiwan's goods exports to the US ($x_i$): $116.3 billion
- US goods exports to Taiwan ($m_i$): $42.4 billion

Substituting into the formula to calculate the hypothetical tariff rate:

$$
TDR = \frac{1163 - 424}{1163} = \frac{739}{1163} \approx 0.635 (63.5\%)
$$

Halving to obtain the final tariff rate:

$$
Final\ Tariff\ Rate = \frac{TDR}{2} = \frac{0.635}{2} \approx 0.3175 (31.75\%)
$$

After rounding, the Trump administration ultimately announced a tariff rate of 32%, consistent with the formula calculation. The 63.5% (approximately 64%) is the "hypothetical tariff rate" used by the Trump administration to justify the policy, while 32% is the actual implemented tariff rate.

White House Deputy Spokesman Kush Desai Said On Social Media That The Tariff Calculation "Does Take Into Account Tariff And Non-Tariff Barriers" And Released An Explanation Of The Original Formula. However, some economists pointed out that the ε × φ in the formula is actually set to 1, which is equal to no effect, indicating that Trump's team may intend to simplify the calculation method to present the results more intuitively and make negotiations easier. 

In a word, public details and numbers are not the key, and Trump's announcement also clearly wrote "Tariffs Charged to the U.S.A. ( Imposition of tariffs on the United States) plus the words "Including Currency Manipulation and Trade Barriers" expresses this non-tariff barrier interpretation space with flexible interpretation, the country If the family is too entangled in the "tariff figures", it may have an adverse impact on the negotiations - the focus is on Trump's hope that countries will sell less or cheaply to the United States, while buying more American goods from the United States, including agricultural products, machinery, parts, energy, etc.

### Limitations of the Formula

The Trump administration's tariff calculation method has significant limitations:

1. **Only considers physical goods trade**: The $x_i$ and $m_i$ in the formula only include physical goods import/export data, ignoring service trade, especially digital services contributions.

2. **Ignores digital economy impact**: Taiwan, as one of the world's most digitalized economies, purchases massive amounts of digital services from the US (such as streaming media, cloud computing, digital advertising, etc.), which should be considered as US exports to Taiwan.

3. **Does not consider long-term economic value**: Digital services not only bring direct income but also provide US companies with data and technological advantages, creating future economic value, which is not factored into consideration.

To more comprehensively reflect the bilateral trade relationship, we need to incorporate digital services into consideration and recalculate the trade deficit and tariff rate.

## Comprehensive Estimation of Taiwan's Digital Service Purchases from the US

### Estimation Goals and Methods

To more accurately assess Taiwan's economic contribution to the US, we will estimate the total amount Taiwan spends annually on US digital services (i.e., US digital exports to Taiwan, Digital Exports, DE). We assume:

- Taiwan population: 23.5 million, netizens: 20 million (85% penetration rate).
- Number of enterprises: 1.5 million, digitalized enterprises: 1.35 million (90% proportion).
- Taiwan GDP: approximately $800 billion, digital economy proportion: 30% ($240 billion).

The estimation adopts an optimistic but reasonable approach, covering ten major categories of digital services, and assumes extremely high market share of US companies in each field to reflect Taiwan's high dependence on US digital services.

### Itemized Estimation

### Total Calculation

Total Digital Exports ($DE_{Total}$):

$$
DE_{Total} = DE_{Streaming} + DE_{Cloud} + DE_{Gaming} + DE_{Ads} + DE_{Cloud\_AI} + DE_{SaaS} + DE_{Ecommerce} + DE_{Education} + DE_{Hardware} + DE_{Others}
$$

$$
DE_{Total} = 5.4 + 3 + 1.8 + 3.4 + 6 + 2.4 + 1.5 + 0.9 + 6 + 3 = 33.4 \text{ (billion dollars)}
$$

Adjusted total: $35 billion

## Recalculation of Trade Deficit and Tariff Rate

### New Trade Deficit Calculation

Including digital exports, total US exports to Taiwan ($Total Exports_{US\_to\_TW}$):

$$
Total Exports_{US\_to\_TW} = Exports_{US\_to\_TW} + DE_{Total}
$$

$$
Total Exports_{US\_to\_TW} = 42.4 + 35 = 77.4 \text{ (billion dollars)}
$$

New trade deficit ($New\_TD$):

$$
New\_TD = Exports_{TW\_to\_US} - Total Exports_{US\_to\_TW}
$$

$$
New\_TD = 116.3 - 77.4 = 38.9 \text{ (billion dollars)}
$$

### New Tariff Rate Calculation

Using the Trump administration's simplified formula, recalculating the hypothetical tariff rate:

$$
New\_TDR = \frac{Exports_{TW\_to\_US} - Total Exports_{US\_to\_TW}}{Exports_{TW\_to\_US}}
$$

$$
New\_TDR = \frac{116.3 - 77.4}{116.3} = \frac{38.9}{116.3} \approx 0.334 \text{ (33.4\%)}
$$

Halving to obtain the new tariff rate ($New\_TR$):

$$
New\_TR = \frac{New\_TDR}{2} = \frac{0.334}{2} \approx 0.167 \text{ (16.7\%)}
$$

### Further Optimization: Considering Future Value of Digital Economy

Digital services not only bring direct income but also provide US companies with data and technological advantages, creating future economic value. Assuming a multiplier effect of 1.5 times for the digital economy, total economic value the US gains from Taiwan ($Total Economic Value, TEV$):

$$
TEV = Total Exports_{US\_to\_TW} + (DE_{Total} \times 0.5)
$$

$$
TEV = 77.4 + (35 \times 0.5) = 77.4 + 17.5 = 94.9 \text{ (billion dollars)}
$$

Optimized trade deficit ($Optimized\_TD$):

$$
Optimized\_TD = 116.3 - 94.9 = 21.4 \text{ (billion dollars)}
$$

Recalculating the hypothetical tariff rate:

$$
Optimized\_TDR = \frac{21.4}{116.3} \approx 0.184 \text{ (18.4\%)}
$$

Halving to obtain the optimized tariff rate ($Optimized\_TR$):

$$
Optimized\_TR = \frac{Optimized\_TDR}{2} = \frac{0.184}{2} \approx 0.092 \text{ (9.2\%)}
$$

## Conclusion and Policy Recommendations

### Summary Data

- Taiwan's total digital service purchases from the US: $35 billion
- Adjusted total US exports to Taiwan: $77.4 billion
- New trade deficit: $38.9 billion
- Recommended tariff rates:
  - Based on new trade deficit: 16.7%
  - Considering future value: 9.2%

### Policy Recommendations

#### Basic Recommendation: Reduce Tariff to 16.7%

Based on the new trade deficit of $38.9 billion, using the Trump administration's simplified formula, 32% should be adjusted to 16.7%, reflecting the direct contribution of the digital economy.

#### Aggressive Recommendation: Reduce Tariff to 9.2% or Lower

Incorporating the future value of the digital economy (total economic value $94.9 billion), the tariff can be further reduced to 9.2%. Considering Taiwan's role as a key US ally in the Asia-Pacific region and its important position in the semiconductor supply chain, we recommend striving for an even lower tariff, such as below 10%.

### Negotiation Strategy

1. Use 16.7% as the negotiation starting point, emphasizing the reasonableness of the data and the importance of the digital economy.
2. Target below 10%, highlighting long-term cooperation benefits and geopolitical value to争取更大減免.

## Conclusion

Taiwan's economic contribution to the US far exceeds the scope of traditional goods trade. The $35 billion in digital service purchases shows that Taiwan is an important market for the US digital economy, and this contribution should be factored into trade balance considerations. Through recalculation, we prove that the 32% tariff rate significantly overestimates the trade deficit and should be adjusted to 16.7%, or even further reduced to 9.2% or lower. This not only aligns with economic fairness principles but also helps deepen strategic cooperation between the US and Taiwan.
