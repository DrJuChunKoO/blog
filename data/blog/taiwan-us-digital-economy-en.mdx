## Introduction: A New Perspective on Trade Balance in the Digital Economy Era

In the wave of globalization and digitalization, traditional trade balance calculations no longer fully reflect the true nature of modern economies. The Trump administration has proposed a 32% tariff on Taiwanese goods, attempting to balance bilateral trade through "reciprocal tariffs" based on the trade deficit with Taiwan. However, this calculation focuses solely on physical goods trade, overlooking Taiwan's massive contribution to the US in the digital economy. As a highly digitized economy, Taiwan purchases tens of billions of dollars in digital services from the US annually, which should be considered as US exports to Taiwan and factored into trade balance considerations.

This report aims to reassess the trade relationship between Taiwan and the US by quantifying Taiwan's purchases of US digital services (i.e., US digital exports to Taiwan) and proposing more reasonable tariff rates. Our goal is to demonstrate that Taiwan's total purchasing power from the US far exceeds current perceptions, and the 32% tariff rate should be significantly reduced to reflect the true value of bilateral economic cooperation and promote long-term stable strategic partnerships.

## The Trump Administration's Tariff Calculation Method: Formula and Limitations

### The Trump Administration's Tariff Formula

When calculating the tariff rate for Taiwan, the Trump administration employed a "reciprocal tariff" method based on trade deficits. According to public information and analysis, the Trump administration's actual calculation method was more simplified than the formula in official documents. Specifically, they first calculated a "hypothetical tariff rate" (Trade Deficit Ratio, TDR), then halved it to arrive at the final tariff rate. The simplified formula is as follows:

```
TDR = (x_i - m_i) / x_i
Final Tariff Rate = TDR / 2
```

Where:
- x_i: Total US imports from country i (i.e., Taiwan's exports to the US)
- m_i: Total US exports to country i

Based on 2025 trade data:
- Taiwan's exports to the US (x_i): $116.3 billion
- US exports to Taiwan (m_i): $42.4 billion

Substituting into the formula to calculate the hypothetical tariff rate:
```
TDR = (116.3 - 42.4) / 116.3
    = 73.9 / 116.3
    ≈ 0.635 (63.5%)
```

Halving to arrive at the final tariff rate:
```
Final Tariff Rate = TDR / 2
                  = 0.635 / 2
                  ≈ 0.3175 (31.75%)
```

After rounding, the Trump administration's final announced tariff rate was 32%, matching the formula calculation. The 63.5% (approximately 64%) is the "hypothetical tariff rate" used by the Trump administration to justify the policy, while 32% is the actual implemented tariff rate.

### Formula Limitations

The Trump administration's tariff calculation method has significant limitations:

1. **Only Considers Physical Goods Trade**: The formula's x_i and m_i only include physical goods import/export data, ignoring service trade, especially digital services contributions.

2. **Ignores Digital Economy Impact**: Taiwan, as one of the world's most digitized economies, heavily purchases US digital services (such as streaming media, cloud computing, digital advertising, etc.), which should be considered as US exports to Taiwan.

3. **Does Not Consider Long-term Economic Value**: Digital services not only bring direct revenue but also provide US companies with data and technological advantages, creating future economic value, which is not factored into consideration.

To more comprehensively reflect the bilateral trade relationship, we need to incorporate digital services and recalculate the trade deficit and tariff rate.

## Comprehensive Estimation of Taiwan's Digital Service Purchases from the US

### Estimation Goals and Methods

To more accurately assess Taiwan's economic contribution to the US, we will estimate Taiwan's annual total purchases of US digital services (i.e., US digital exports to Taiwan, DE). We assume:

- Taiwan population: 23.5 million, with 20 million internet users (85% penetration rate)
- 1.5 million businesses, with 1.35 million digitized businesses (90% ratio)
- Taiwan GDP approximately $800 billion, with digital economy accounting for 30% ($240 billion)

The estimation employs an optimistic but reasonable approach, covering ten major categories of digital services, and assumes extremely high market share for US companies in each field to reflect Taiwan's high dependency on US digital services.

### Itemized Estimates

#### 1. Streaming and Content Subscription Services

- **Scope**: Netflix, YouTube Premium, Disney+, Spotify, HBO Max, Twitch, etc.
- **Assumption**: 18 million internet users (90%) subscribe to US streaming services, with annual spending of $300.

  DE_Ads = (2,500,000,000 × 0.95) + 1,000,000,000 = 3,375,000,000 ($3.375 billion)
  ```
- **Result**: $3.4 billion (adjusted)

#### 5. Cloud Computing and AI Services

- **Scope**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, AI tools (OpenAI, Anthropic), data analytics services.
- **Assumption**: Market size $3 billion, US companies' share 95%, AI services spending $3 billion.
- **Calculation**:
  ```
  DE_Cloud_AI = (3,000,000,000 × 0.95) + 3,000,000,000 = 5,850,000,000 ($5.85 billion)
  ```
- **Result**: $6 billion (adjusted)

#### 6. Software as a Service (SaaS) and Enterprise Software

- **Scope**: Microsoft 365, Adobe Creative Cloud, Salesforce, Zoom, Oracle, SAP US products, etc.
- **Assumption**: 945,000 businesses with annual spending of $800, 8 million individuals with annual spending of $200.
- **Calculation**:
  ```
  DE_SaaS = (945,000 × 800) + (8,000,000 × 200) = 2,356,000,000 ($2.356 billion)
  ```
- **Result**: $2.4 billion (adjusted)

#### 7. E-commerce and Platform Economy

- **Scope**: Amazon, eBay, Shopify, PayPal, Stripe, cross-border e-commerce service fees, etc.

  ```
- **Result**: $6 billion

#### 10. Other Digital Services and Indirect Contributions

- **Scope**: VPN, digital security (Norton, McAfee), payment processing fees (Visa, Mastercard US portion), US subsidiary revenue in Taiwan.
- **Assumption**: Supplementary total of $3 billion.
- **Result**: $3 billion

### Total Calculation

Total Digital Exports (DE_Total):
```
DE_Total = DE_Streaming + DE_Cloud + DE_Gaming + DE_Ads + DE_Cloud_AI + DE_SaaS + DE_Ecommerce + DE_Education + DE_Hardware + DE_Others
DE_Total = 5.4 + 3 + 1.8 + 3.4 + 6 + 2.4 + 1.5 + 0.9 + 6 + 3 = 33.4 (billion dollars)
```

Adjusted total: $35 billion

## Recalculating Trade Deficit and Tariff Rate

### New Trade Deficit Calculation

Including digital exports, total US exports to Taiwan (Total Exports_US_to_TW):
```
Total Exports_US_to_TW = Exports_US_to_TW + DE_Total
Total Exports_US_to_TW = 42.4 + 35 = 77.4 (billion dollars)
```

New trade deficit (New_TD):
```
New_TD = Exports_TW_to_US - Total Exports_US_to_TW
New_TD = 116.3 - 77.4 = 38.9 (billion dollars)
```

### New Tariff Rate Calculation

Using the Trump administration's simplified formula, recalculating the hypothetical tariff rate:
```
New_TDR = (Exports_TW_to_US - Total Exports_US_to_TW) / Exports_TW_to_US
New_TDR = (116.3 - 77.4) / 116.3
        = 38.9 / 116.3
        ≈ 0.334 (33.4%)
```

Halving to arrive at the new tariff rate (New_TR):
```
New_TR = New_TDR / 2
       = 0.334 / 2
       ≈ 0.167 (16.7%)
```

### Further Optimization: Considering Future Value of Digital Economy

Digital services not only bring direct revenue but also provide US companies with data and technological advantages, creating future economic value. Assuming a multiplier effect of 1.5x for the digital economy, total economic value (TEV) gained by the US from Taiwan:
```
TEV = Total Exports_US_to_TW + (DE_Total × 0.5)
TEV = 77.4 + (35 × 0.5)
    = 77.4 + 17.5
    = 94.9 (billion dollars)
```

Optimized trade deficit (Optimized_TD):
```
Optimized_TD = 116.3 - 94.9 = 21.4 (billion dollars)
```

Recalculating the hypothetical tariff rate:
```
Optimized_TDR = 21.4 / 116.3
              ≈ 0.184 (18.4%)
```

Halving to arrive at the optimized tariff rate (Optimized_TR):
```
Optimized_TR = Optimized_TDR / 2
             = 0.184 / 2
             ≈ 0.092 (9.2%)
```

## Conclusions and Policy Recommendations

### Summary Data

- Taiwan's total digital service purchases from the US: $35 billion
- Adjusted total US exports to Taiwan: $77.4 billion
- New trade deficit: $38.9 billion
- Recommended tariff rates:
  - Based on new trade deficit: 16.7%
  - Considering future value: 9.2%

### Policy Recommendations

#### Basic Recommendation: Reduce Tariff to 16.7%

Based on the new trade deficit of $38.9 billion, using the Trump administration's simplified formula, the 32% should be adjusted to 16.7%, reflecting the direct contribution of the digital economy.

#### Aggressive Recommendation: Reduce Tariff to 9.2% or Lower

Incorporating the future value of the digital economy (total economic value of $94.9 billion), the tariff can be further reduced to 9.2%. Considering Taiwan's role as a key US ally in the Asia-Pacific region and its important position in the semiconductor supply chain, we recommend pursuing an even lower tariff, such as below 10%.

### Negotiation Strategy

1. Use 16.7% as the negotiation starting point, emphasizing the reasonableness of the data and the importance of the digital economy.
2. Target below 10% as the goal, highlighting long-term cooperation benefits and geopolitical value to secure greater reductions.

## Conclusion

Taiwan's economic contribution to the US far exceeds the scope of traditional goods trade. The $35 billion in digital service purchases demonstrates that Taiwan is a significant market for the US digital economy, and this contribution should be factored into trade balance considerations. Through recalculation, we prove that the 32% tariff rate significantly overestimates the trade deficit and should be adjusted to 16.7%, or even further reduced to 9.2% or lower. This not only aligns with economic fairness principles but also helps deepen strategic cooperation between the US and Taiwan.
