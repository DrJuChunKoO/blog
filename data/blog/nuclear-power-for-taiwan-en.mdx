[January 9 Full Episode - Elon Musk and AfD's Alice Weidel Discuss Germany’s Future.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvqmBEQO-_E)

Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk engaged in a deep discussion with Alice Weidel, a representative of Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, sparking widespread global debate on energy policies. Their conversation highlighted Germany's grave mistakes in pursuing an anti-nuclear agenda, serving as a crucial lesson for Taiwan. I must reiterate: Nuclear power must not be abandoned blindly. Taiwan urgently needs to pass legislation for extending nuclear plant operations and transitioning toward a "New Nuclear Homeland."

## Musk’s Bold Assertion: Germany’s Closure of Nuclear Plants Was a "Tragic Mistake"

During the discussion, Musk described Germany's nuclear plant closures as a "tragic mistake." He emphasized:  
*"I think nuclear energy is severely underappreciated. In fact, these plants are designed exceptionally well. A significant increase in nuclear power production would be the right move for Germany."*  

Musk’s perspective is more than an isolated opinion. As a leader in electric vehicle and space technology industries, he possesses deep industrial and scientific insights into energy supply and demand. While not opposed to green energy, Musk warns that renewable sources, though important, cannot yet fully replace the stable base-load power provided by nuclear energy.

## Alice Weidel of AfD: Industrial Nations Cannot Rely Solely on Solar and Wind Energy

As a representative of one of Germany’s largest opposition parties, Weidel also issued a cautionary note. She pointed out that Germany is the only industrial nation to shut down its nuclear plants. Criticizing former Chancellor Angela Merkel's overly idealistic reliance on solar and wind power, she stated:  
*"When the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow, industrial nations simply cannot depend on these sources alone."*  

Weidel further provided data: Replacing a single nuclear power plant generating approximately 10 billion kWh annually would require over 1,250 modern wind turbines occupying about 100 square kilometers—half the area of Stuttgart. For a small, densely populated country like Taiwan, this is an impossible task.

## Renewable Energy Limitations in High-Latitude Regions

Musk also highlighted another critical factor: Geographic location significantly impacts the output of solar and wind energy. Germany’s high latitude results in shorter daylight hours during winter and seasonal variations, making it challenging to meet nationwide electricity demand even with large-scale energy storage systems.

Similarly, while Taiwan enjoys better sunlight conditions due to its lower latitude, typhoon seasons, heavy rains, or storm impacts can damage solar panels and necessitate wind turbine shutdowns, compromising the reliability of renewable energy. It’s crucial to recognize that reliance on a single energy source is unsustainable, and advanced nations should avoid the strategic error of "abandoning nuclear."

## Taiwan’s Energy Transition: A Pragmatic Mixed Approach Is Needed

Germany’s energy tragedy demonstrates that chasing green energy while neglecting nuclear power will inevitably harm industrial competitiveness and household electricity needs. Taiwan, a global semiconductor hub with 24/7 operational factories, requires stable, sufficient, and relatively clean power supply. Energy policy inconsistencies heightening risks of power shortages will deter foreign investment and cripple Taiwan's competitiveness.

As Musk aptly noted:  
*"Solutions must be multifaceted, incorporating renewable energy but also retaining a certain degree of fossil fuel and especially nuclear energy."*

From my perspective, Taiwan’s optimal strategy involves:  
1. **Extending Nuclear Plant Operations:** Ensure stable base-load electricity by maintaining existing nuclear power plants.  
2. **Expanding Renewable Energy:** Invest in solar, wind, and energy storage technologies, focusing on precision site selection, quality, and efficiency.  
3. **Enhancing Regulations and Safety Design:** Adopt the latest nuclear technologies, optimize safety standards, and reassure the public about nuclear energy’s safety.  
4. **Reducing Fossil Fuel Dependence:** Fossil fuel price fluctuations and high import reliance make this approach unsustainable long-term.

## Conclusion: Passing Legislation for Extending Nuclear Plant Operations Is Imperative for Taiwan's Next Generation

The DPP government has long pushed for a "nuclear-free homeland by 2025." However, the shortcomings of renewable energy and the supply-demand gap in electricity have never been adequately addressed. Germany’s painful experience has repeatedly proven that blind abandonment of nuclear energy leads to dire consequences in energy shortages and industrial decline. Taiwan needs a realistic, scientific, and pragmatic energy policy that ensures the public can "afford electricity and feel secure using it."

I call on Taiwan to urgently pass legislation extending nuclear plant operations, reassess nuclear energy's role in the overall energy structure, and promote research into new nuclear technologies alongside improved safety mechanisms. Only by integrating "green energy" and "nuclear energy" can we achieve stable power supply and carbon reduction goals. This is not only crucial for maintaining economic growth but also for ensuring the survival and prosperity of Taiwan’s next generation.

I am KMT Tech Legislator Ge Ru-Jun. Let us approach energy transition with a scientific and rational mindset to build a truly sustainable, stable, and safe future for Taiwan.  

Nuclear energy should not be demonized; Taiwan’s future demands a more pragmatic and stable energy policy.  

Thank you for your support and attention. Please continue to follow Taiwan’s energy policy developments as we work together to protect this land for the next generation.
