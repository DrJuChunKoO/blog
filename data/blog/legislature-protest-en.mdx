The Legislative Yuan has recently descended into unprecedented chaos. Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators have launched a large-scale protest within the parliamentary chamber, not only occupying key areas of the venue but also laying out a massive Chinese character "罷" (meaning "recall") in the center of the red carpet, symbolizing their intent to recall Kuomintang (KMT) legislators. The entire chamber is covered with protest slogans and "X" markings, with even the area beneath Dr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait not spared.

This protest action has not only obstructed normal legislative procedures but also raised serious concerns about the stability of Taiwan's democratic institutions. As the ruling party, the DPP's actions effectively paralyze their own government's operations, preventing scheduled legislative reviews and questioning sessions from proceeding. The empty seats and boycotted meetings in the chamber reflect the severity of the current political divide.

Most notably, this protest is being led by the ruling party, rather than traditional opposition resistance. When the governing party chooses to abandon its responsibilities of governance and instead obstructs parliamentary operations, Taiwan's constitutional system faces unprecedented challenges.

International media and political observers have expressed concern about the incident, viewing it as a reflection of the increasingly polarized political environment in Taiwan. For a country with mature democratic development, it is rare to see a ruling party obstruct parliamentary operations in such an extreme manner.
