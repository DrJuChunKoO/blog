## A Year of DPP Rule: Recalls and Strikes Over Governance

After nearly a year in power, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has mired Taiwan in a political quagmire of "recalls, strikes, and paralysis," ignoring seismic global shifts. Has President Lai Ching-te even glanced at a calendar? The era of Trump's leadership has begun, with international focus on tariffs, AI, space, drones, and government efficiency (e.g., the U.S.'s DOGE initiative)—not the outdated "Democratic Alliance" ideology.

## Outdated Ideology: DPP Clings to the Past

The DPP rose on progressive, diverse issues, but the global winds have shifted. Yet, the party remains stuck in past glories, believing ideology and "Democratic Alliance" rhetoric can govern a nation. While diversity matters, global competition now centers on new defense technologies, AI, energy, tariffs, and government efficiency—areas where the DPP has shown little progress.

## Energy Policy Lag: A Decade of Nuclear Obstruction

On energy, the U.S. is extending the lifespan of its nuclear plants, with over 60 of 96 approved for extended operation, 22 up to 80 years. Germany is debating reactivating six reactors. Yet, the DPP fixates on the decommissioned Nuclear Plants 1 and 2, clinging to its "nuclear-free homeland" stance. For a decade, the DPP has obstructed nuclear discussions in the Legislative Yuan. As committee convener, I allocated four hours for debate yesterday, only for the DPP to twice adjourn proceedings, stalling progress in an embarrassing display.

## Diplomatic Blunders: Straining Ties with Trump's Camp

More alarming are the DPP's diplomatic missteps. Before the U.S. election, Taiwan Plus called Trump a "felon," and Academia Sinica underestimated his victory odds, showing bias. Post-election, the DPP met with three individuals on Trump's "ten-person blacklist." During my U.S. visit, I heard of American frustration with the DPP's ineptitude in asymmetric warfare, energy, and AI. The DPP's "chess player" rhetoric may have even crossed a red line with Trump's team.

## Shut Out: Lai's Government Risks 'Troublemaker' Label

The Ministry of Economic Affairs sent a deputy minister to the U.S. for "communication," only to return empty-handed after a month, rebranding the trip as "intelligence gathering." This suggests the Lai administration may be labeled by Trump's team as a "troublemaker" stuck in the Democratic Party's past—a potential "Zelenskyy 2.0." Reports of the DPP spending heavily to win Trump's favor, only to be shut out, are unsurprising.

## Refusal to Adapt: DPP Faces Long-Term Isolation

As long as the DPP obsesses over ideology, manipulates public sentiment, and clings to "Democratic Alliance" slogans—while neglecting governance, economic growth, and fiscal restraint—it will face consequences. The DPP cries poverty while attacking the opposition, ignores the AIT's three hints to revive nuclear power, and obstructs legislative proceedings. If this continues, President Lai and the DPP risk becoming long-term pariahs in Trump's circle.

## KMT's Call: DPP Must Evolve with the Times

The KMT urges the DPP not to be the party that fails to read the room—or the times. President Lai and the DPP must face reality and adapt, or Taiwan risks growing marginalization on the global stage.
