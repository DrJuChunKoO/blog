In recent years, discussions about energy have intensified in Taiwanese society.

However, Taiwan has entered an "energy security dilemma" caught between ideals and reality, environmental protection and energy needs, economic concerns and national security. As concerned members of society, we must carefully consider Taiwan's path forward.

## I. Energy Security = National Security

Some might ask: Is energy truly related to national security? The answer is definitively yes. Our current energy structure means that our nation's most critical power source could be controlled or cut off by external forces, with unimaginable consequences.

Currently, 17% of Taiwan's electricity comes from coal, and nearly 50% from natural gas; the government plans to increase the natural gas proportion to over 50%. The problem lies in the fact that Taiwan relies on imports for almost 100% of its natural gas, transported via large LNG vessels, with hundreds of ships docking annually. Any international political turbulence, shipping route disruptions, or supplier restrictions (even from friendly nations) could plunge Taiwan into an energy crisis. The European natural gas crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war serves as a vivid lesson.
